# EEPs

Large changes to estimagic can be proposed in estimagic enhancement proposals, short
EEPs. They serve the purpose of summarising discussions
that may happen in chats, issues, pull requests, in person, or by any other means.
Simple extensions (like adding new optimizers) do not need to be discussed with such
a formal process.

If the author of an EEP feels that it is ready to be accepted they need to make a
post in our [zulip workspace](https://ose.zulipchat.com) and a comment on the PR that
contains the following information:

1. Summary of all contentious aspects of the EEP and how they have been resolved
2. Every interested party has seven days to comment on the PR proposing the EEP,
   either with approval or objections.
3. If there are no unresolved objections after seven days, the EEP will automatically
   be accepted.

Note that the Pull Requests that actually implement the proposed enhancements still
require a standard review cycle.

These EEPs are currently in place:
