Roadmap
=======

Features that are not yet implemented, but planned:

- Add several solvers that support nonlinear constraints (some ``nlopt``
  solvers, some ``scipy`` solvers) and harmonize the way how nonlinear constraints are
  specified.
- Add global optimizers that use large scale parallelization.
- Add options to "globalize" local optimizers by starting them from randomly
  chosen starting points.
