Installation
============


Basic installation
==================

The package can be installed via conda. To do so, type the following commands in
a terminal or shell:

.. code-block::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge

.. code-block::

    conda install estimagic

The first line adds conda-forge to your conda channels. This is necessary for
conda to find all dependencies of estimagic. The second line installs estimagic
and its mandatory dependencies.


Installing optional dependencies
================================

Only ``scipy`` is a mandatory dependency of estimagic. Other algorithms
become available if you install more packages. We make this optional because most of the
time you will use at least one additional package, but only very rarely will you need all
of them.


For an overview of all optimizers and the packages you need to install to enable them,
see :ref:`list_of_algorithms`.


To enable all algorithms at once, do the following:

.. code-block::

    conda install nlopt

.. code-block::

    pip install Py-BOBYQA

.. code-block::

    pip install DFO-LS

.. code-block::

    conda install petsc4py

*Note*: ```petsc4py``` is not available on Windows.

.. code-block::

    conda install cyipopt

.. code-block::

    conda install pygmo

.. code-block::

    pip install fides>=0.7.4

*Note*: Make sure you have at least 0.7.1.
