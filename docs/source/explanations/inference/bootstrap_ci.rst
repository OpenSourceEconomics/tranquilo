Bootstrap Confidence Intervals
********************************
We use the notation and formulations provided in chapter 10 of :cite:`Hansen2020`.

The first supported confidence interval type is the **"percentile"** confidence
interval, as discussed in section 10.10 of the Hansen textbook.
Let :math:`\{ \hat{\theta}_1^*, ..., \hat{\theta}_B^*\}` denote the estimates of
estimator :math:`\hat{\theta}` for the B bootstrap samples. The idea of the percentile
confidence interval is to simply take the empirical quantiles :math:`q_{p}^*` of
this distributions, so we have

.. math:: CI^{percentile} = [q_{\alpha/2}^*, q_{1-\alpha/2}^*].

The second supported confidence interval **"normal"** is based on a normal approximation
and discussed in Hansen's section 10.9.
Let :math:`s_{boot}` be the sample standard error of the distribution
of bootstrap estimators, :math:`z_q` the q-quantile of a standard normal
distribution and :math:`\hat{\theta}` be the full sample estimate of :math:`\theta`.
Then, the asymptotic normal confidence interval is given by

.. math::

    CI^{normal} = [\hat{\theta} - z_{1- \alpha/2} s_{boot},
    \hat{\theta} + z_{1- \alpha/2} s_{boot}].

The bias-corrected **"bc"** bootstrap confidence interval addresses the issue of biased
estimators. This problem is often present when estimating nonlinear models. Econometric
details are discussed in section 10.17 of Hansen. Let

.. math:: p^* = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B 1(\hat{\theta}_b^* \leq \hat{\theta})

and define :math:`z_0^* = \Phi^{-1} (p^*)`, where :math:`\Phi` is the standard normal
cdf. The bias correction works via correcting the significance level.
Define :math:`x(\alpha) = \Phi(z_\alpha + 2 z_0^*)` as the corrected significance level
for a target significant level of :math:`\alpha`. Then, the bias-corrected confidence
interval is given by

.. math:: CI^{bc} = [q_{x(\alpha/2)}^*, q_{x(1-\alpha/2)}^*].


A further refined version of the bias-corrected confidence interval is the
bias-corrected and accelerated interval, short **"bca"**, as discussed in section 10.20
of Hansen. The general idea is to correct for skewness sampling distribution.
Downsides of this confidence interval are that it takes quite a lot of time to compute,
since it features calculating leave-one-out estimates of the original sample.
Formally, again, the significance levels are adjusted. Define

.. math::

    \hat{a}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\bar{\theta}-\hat{\theta}_{(-i)}\right)^{3}}
    {6\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\bar{\theta}-\hat{\theta}_{(-i)}\right)^{2}
    \right)^{3 / 2}},

where :math:`\bar{\theta}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \widehat{\theta}_{(-i)}`.
This is an estimator for the skewness of :math:`\hat{\theta}`. Then, the corrected
significance level is given by

.. math:: x(\alpha)=\Phi(z_{0}+\frac{z_{\alpha}+z_{0}}{1-a(z_{\alpha}+z_{0})})

and the bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval is given by

.. math:: CI^{bca} = [q_{x(\alpha/2)}^*, q_{x(1-\alpha/2)}^*].

The studentized confidence interval, here called **"t"** type confidence interval first
studentizes the bootstrap parameter distribution, i.e. applies the transformation
:math:`\frac{\hat{\theta}_b-\hat{\theta}}{s_{boot}}`, and then builds
the confidence interval based on the estimated quantile function of the studentized
data :math:`\hat{G}`:

.. math::

    CI^{t} = \left[\hat{\theta}+\hat{\sigma} \hat{G}^{-1}(\alpha / 2),
    \hat{\theta}+\hat{\sigma} \hat{G}^{-1}(1-\alpha / 2)\right]

The final supported confidence interval method is the **"basic"** bootstrap confidence
interval, which is derived in section 3.4 of :cite:`Wassermann2006`, where it is called
the pivotal confidence interval. It is given by

.. math::
    CI^{basic} = \left[\hat{\theta}+\left(\hat{\theta}-\hat{\theta}_{u}^{\star}\right),
    \hat{\theta}+\left(\hat{\theta}-\hat{\theta}_{l}^{\star}\right)\right],

where :math:`\hat{\theta}_{u}^{\star}` denotes the :math:`1-\alpha/2` empirical quantile
of the bootstrap estimate distribution for parameter :math:`\theta` and
:math:`\hat{\theta}_{l}^{\star}` denotes the :math:`\alpha/2` quantile.
