"""Finite difference formulae for jacobians and hessians.

All functions in this module should not only work for the simple case
of one positive and/or one negative step, but also for the Richardson
Extrapolation case with several positive and/or several negative steps.

Since steps and evals contain NaNs, we have to make sure that the functions do not raise
warnings or errors for that case.

    Notation: f:R^dim_x -> R^dim_f. We compute the derivative at x0, with f0 = f(x0).

    The formulae in Rideout [2009] which are implemented here use three types of
    function evaluations:

    1. f(theta + delta_j e_j)
    2. f(theta + delta_j e_j + delta_k e_k)
    3. f(theta + delta_j e_j - delta_k e_k)

    Which are called here: 1. ``evals_one``, 2. ``evals_two`` and 3. ``evals_cross``,
    corresponding to the idea that we are moving in one direction, in two directions and
    in two cross directions (opposite signs). Note that theta denotes x0, delta_j the
    step size for the j-th variable and e_j the j-th standard basis vector.

    Note also that the brackets in the finite difference formulae are not arbitrary but
    improve the numerical accuracy, see Rideout [2009].

        evals (dict[namedtuple]): Dictionary with keys "one_step" for function evals in
            a single step direction, "two_step" for evals in two steps in the same
            direction, and "cross_step" for evals in two steps in the opposite
            direction. Each dict item has the fields called pos and neg for evaluations
            with positive and negative steps, respectively. Each field is a numpy array
            of shape (n_steps, dim_f, dim_x). It contains np.nan for evaluations that
            failed or were not attempted because a one-sided derivative rule was chosen.
        steps (namedtuple): Namedtuple with the fields pos and neg. Each field
            contains a numpy array of shape (n_steps, dim_x) with the steps in
            the corresponding direction. The steps are always symmetric, in the sense

            These correspond to the finite difference approximations defined in
