    To activate this, set the number of interpolation points at which to evaluate the
    criterion before doing the first step, `min_initial_points`, to something smaller
    than the number of parameters.

    The following options can be specified:

        min_initial_points (int): Number of initial interpolation
            points in addition to the start point. This should only be changed to
            a value less than ``len(x)``, and only if the default setup cost
            of ``len(x) + 1`` evaluations of the criterion is impractical.
            If this is set to be less than the default, the input value of
            ``n_interpolation_points`` should be set to ``len(x)``.
            If the default is used, all the other parameters have no effect.
            Default is ``n_interpolation_points - 1``.
            If the default setup costs of the evaluations are very large, DF-OLS
            can start with less than ``len(x)`` interpolation points and add points
            to the trust region model with every iteration.
        method ("jacobian", "trustregion" or "auto"):
            When there are less interpolation points than ``len(x)`` the model is
            underdetermined. This can be fixed in two ways:
            If "jacobian", the interpolated Jacobian is perturbed to have full
            rank, allowing the trust region step to include components in the full
            search space. This is the default if
            ``len(x) \geq number of root contributions``.
            If "trustregion_step", the trust region step is perturbed by an
            orthogonal direction not yet searched. It is the default if
            ``len(x) < number of root contributions``.
        scale_of_trustregion_step_perturbation (float):
            When adding new search directions, the length of the step is the trust
            region radius multiplied by this value. The default is 0.1 if
            ``method == "trustregion"`` else 1.
        scale_of_jacobian_components_perturbation (float): Magnitude of extra
            components added to the Jacobian. Default is 1e-2.
        floor_of_jacobian_singular_values (float): Floor singular
            values of the Jacobian at this factor of the last non zero value.
            As of version 1.2.1 this option is not yet supported by DF-OLS!
        scale_of_jacobian_singular_value_floor (float):
            Floor singular values of the Jacobian at this factor of the last nonzero
            value.
        jacobian_max_condition_number (float): Cap on the condition number
            of Jacobian after applying floors to singular values
            (effectively another floor on the smallest singular value, since the
            largest singular value is fixed).
        geometry_improving_steps (bool): Whether to do geometry-improving steps in the
            trust region algorithm, as per the usual algorithm during the fast start.
        safety_steps (bool):
            Whether to perform safety steps.
        shrink_upper_radius_in_safety_steps (bool): During the fast start whether to
            shrink the upper trust region radius in safety steps.
        full_geometry_improving_step (bool): During the fast start whether to do a
            full geometry-improving step within safety steps (the same as the post fast
            start phase of the algorithm). Since this involves reducing the upper trust
            region radius, this can only be `True` if
            `shrink_upper_radius_in_safety_steps == False`.
        reset_trustregion_radius_after_fast_start (bool):
            Whether or not to reset the upper trust region radius to its initial value
            at the end of the fast start phase.
        reset_min_trustregion_radius_after_fast_start (bool):
            Whether or not to reset the minimum trust region radius
            (:math:`\rho_k`) to its initial value at the end of the fast start phase.
        shrinking_factor_not_successful (float):
            Ratio by which to shrink the trust region radius when realized
            improvement does not match the ``threshold_for_successful_iteration``
            during the fast start phase.  By default it is the same as
            ``reduction_when_not_successful``.
        n_extra_search_directions_per_iteration (int): Number of new search
            directions to add with each iteration where we do not have a full set
            of search directions. This approach is not recommended! Default is 0.
