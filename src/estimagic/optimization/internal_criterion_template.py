    """Template for the internal criterion and derivative function.

    This function forms the basis of all functions that define the optimization problem
    and are passed to the internal optimizers in estimagic. I.e. the criterion,
    derivative and criterion_and_derivative functions.

    Most of the arguments of this function will be partialled in before the functions
    are passed to internal optimizers.

    That is the reason why this function is called a template.

    Args:
        x (np.ndarray): 1d numpy array with internal parameters.
        task (str): One of "criterion", "derivative" and "criterion_and_derivative".
        direction (str): One of "maximize" or "minimize"
        criterion (callable): (partialed) user provided criterion function that takes a
            parameter dataframe as only argument and returns a scalar, an array like
            object or a dictionary. See :ref:`criterion`.
        params (pd.DataFrame): see :ref:`params`
        converter (Converter): NamedTuple with methods to convert between internal
            and external derivatives, parameters and criterion outputs.
        algo_info (AlgoInfo): NamedTuple with attributes
            - primary_criterion_entry
            - name
            - parallelizes
            - disable_cache
            - needs_scaling
            - is_available
        derivative (callable, optional): (partialed) user provided function that
            calculates the first derivative of criterion. For most algorithm, this is
            the gradient of the scalar output (or "value" entry of the dict). However
            some algorithms (e.g. bhhh) require the jacobian of the "contributions"
            entry of the dict. You will get an error if you provide the wrong type of
            derivative.
        criterion_and_derivative (callable): Function that returns criterion
            and derivative as a tuple. This can be used to exploit synergies in the
            evaluation of both functions. The fist element of the tuple has to be
            exactly the same as the output of criterion. The second has to be exactly
            the same as the output of derivative.
        numdiff_options (dict): Keyword arguments for the calculation of numerical
            derivatives. See :ref:`first_derivative` for details. Note that the default
            method is changed to "forward" for speed reasons.
        logging (bool): Wether logging is used.
        db_kwargs (dict): Dictionary with entries "database", "path" and "fast_logging".
        error_handling (str): Either "raise" or "continue". Note that "continue" does
            not absolutely guarantee that no error is raised but we try to handle as
            many errors as possible in that case without aborting the optimization.
        error_penalty (dict): Dict with the entries "constant" (float) and "slope"
            (float). If the criterion or derivative raise an error and error_handling is
            "continue", return ``constant + slope * norm(params - start_params)`` where
            ``norm`` is the euclidean distance as criterion value and adjust the
            derivative accordingly. This is meant to guide the optimizer back into a
            valid region of parameter space (in direction of the start parameters).
            Note that the constant has to be high enough to ensure that the penalty is
            actually a bad function value. The default constant is 2 times the criterion
            value at the start parameters. The default slope is 0.1.
        first_criterion_evaluation (dict): Dictionary with entries "internal_params",
            "external_params", "output".
        cache (dict): Dictionary used as cache for criterion and derivative evaluations.
        cache_size (int): Number of evaluations that are kept in cache. Default 10.
        fixed_log_data (dict): Dictionary with fixed data to be saved in the database.
            Has the entries "stage" (str) and "substage" (int).

    Returns:
        float, np.ndarray or tuple: If task=="criterion" it returns the output of
            criterion which can be a float or 1d numpy array. If task=="derivative" it
            returns the first derivative of criterion, which is a numpy array.
            If task=="criterion_and_derivative" it returns both as a tuple.
